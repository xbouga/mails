# HTML Email Template - Image-Free Implementation

This repository demonstrates how to create HTML email templates that achieve stunning visual effects without relying on external images, improving deliverability and compatibility across email clients.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Email templates often rely heavily on images for visual appeal, but this approach can lead to:
- Images being blocked by email clients
- Poor deliverability rates
- Broken layouts when images fail to load
